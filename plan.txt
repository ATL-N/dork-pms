  Absolutely. Based on our strategy of keeping the Flocks page as the daily action hub, the Feed, Health, and Production pages
  will serve as dedicated management and analysis centers. This creates a clear and streamlined workflow for all users.

  Here is the detailed plan for each page. Please review it, and once you approve, I will begin developing the Feed page.

  ---

  1. Feed Page (/feed) - Inventory & Formulation Hub

  Purpose: To manage the farm's feed inventory and custom formulations. This page is for strategic oversight, not for logging
  daily consumption.

  This structure ensures each page has a clear purpose, preventing user confusion and making the application much more
  powerful and intuitive.

  Please let me know if this plan aligns with your vision, and I will begin with the Feed page.


Of course. It's a great idea to review the full scope to ensure everything is cohesive. Here is the planned content and
  functionality for the remaining pages, following our streamlined design philosophy.

As requested, here is the list of remaining tasks to complete Phase 3 of the development plan.

  Remaining Tasks for Phase 3

  1. Financial Management:
   * Invoices Tab:
       * Build the UI to display a list of invoices from the local database.
       * Implement the logic to fetch and sync invoices from the backend API.
   * Add/Edit Invoice Page:
       * Complete the form with all necessary fields (e.g., invoiceNumber, date, dueDate, amount, customer).
       * Implement the logic to save new invoices to the local database and queue them for background synchronization.
   * Transactions Logic:
       * Ensure the existing "Add Transaction" form correctly saves data offline and syncs properly.

  2. Health Management:
   * Health Page:
       * Implement the UI to display a list of health tasks, ideally grouped by flock or sorted by date.
       * Write the logic to fetch health tasks from the local database and sync with the backend.
   * Log Health Task Page:
       * Build out the form with all required fields (e.g., taskName, taskType, scheduledDate, medicationUsed).
       * Implement the save logic to store the task locally and queue it for syncing.
       * Add logic to automatically update the stock of a medication in the inventory when a health task is logged as
         complete.

  3. Staff Management (Online-Only):
   * Staff Page:
       * Build the UI to display a list of staff members for the farm.
       * Implement the API call to fetch the staff list.
   * Invite Staff Page:
       * Complete the form with fields for the staff member's email and their assigned role.
       * Implement the logic to call the backend API to send an invitation.
       * Handle potential network errors gracefully since this is an online-only action.



Here are the remaining actions to complete Phase 4 based on the project plan:

  1. Finalize the Chat Feature

   * Real-time Connection (WebSocket):
       * Implement a WebSocket client to connect to the backend socket server (/api/socket).
       * Integrate this client into the ChatDetailsPage to listen for new messages in real-time when the device is
         online.
       * Update the sendMessage logic to also send messages through the WebSocket when online, in addition to saving
         them locally.
   * Backend Synchronization:
       * Implement the logic in the ChatRepository to fetch existing conversations and messages from the backend API
         (/api/chat/...).
       * Create a mechanism to periodically sync this data with the local Drift database.
   * "General Chat" Logic:
       * Implement the on-demand logic described in the plan. When the ConversationsPage loads, it should check with the
         backend if the user is in the "General Chat" and create it locally if they are not.

  2. Implement Push Notifications

   * Firebase Integration:
       * Ensure the Flutter app is correctly connected to a Firebase project for both Android and iOS.
       * Initialize firebase_messaging within the app.
   * Permission Handling:
       * Add the logic to request notification permissions from the user upon app start or when they first visit the
         chat.
   * Token Management:
       * Retrieve the FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) token for the device and send it to your backend to associate it
         with the current user.
   * Notification Handling:
       * Foreground: Implement a listener to handle incoming notifications while the app is open and in use.
       * Background & Terminated: Configure background message handlers to process notifications when the app is not in
         the foreground. This is the key to triggering background data syncs as planned.
